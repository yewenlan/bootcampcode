# Project Description

Get through the AICS developing process with necessary testing and coding convention.

## Goal

* Set up your project on AICS GitHub
* Set up your IDE
* Implement functions and tests
* Set up SonarCloud
* Refine your code according to AICS coding convention
* Create you Pull Requests
* Get an approval of your PR (nice to have)

## Description

Please follow these documents and get through every instruction to be familiar with the AICS developing process.

### Set up your own bootcamp coding project

Set up your GitHub repository to record all your practice.

### Set up VSCode

Choose the language you are more familiar with.

* **Javascript**

  * [Working with JavaScript in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/working-with-javascript)
  * [Build Node.js Apps with Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial)
  * [Debug Node.js Apps using Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging)
* **Python**

  * [Get Started Tutorial for Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)
  * [Linting Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting)
  * [Debugging configurations for Python apps in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging)
  * [Using Python Environments in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments)

### Implement functions and tests

Here are two "calculator" sample codes. You can choose either one according to the language you prefer.
And then, you need to implement the corresponding functions and tests.

* **Javascript**: js_calculator
* **Python**: py_calulator

The objectives are practicing the test framework and test writing to get you ready for the next part.
By the way, since they are just samples, you can change their architectures to your needs.

### Learn the coding style and convention

Apply the code style and set up SonarCloud to help you make your code work readable and easy to understand.

### Learn the best practice of AICS code review

Create or modify your "git commit" according to AICS criteria. Prepare your "Pull Request" and ask for a code review.

## Evaluation

The criteria are as simple as below:

* poor (not all items finished)
* average (finish all items on time)
* good (pull request is reviewed and approved by one of the committee with positive comments ahead of schedule)
